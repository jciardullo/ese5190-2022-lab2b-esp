### Overview:

The python program's terminal asks the user to choose from a number of options:

* Record 5 seconds of button input (R)
* Replay the recorded sequence (P)
* Loop the recording (L)
* Save the recording to your laptop as recording.txt (S)
* Load the recording from your laptop's recording.txt (LD)

The user can choose pick any option and interact with the boot button as the recording input for the program.

You can test the save and load features with the pre-existing recording.txt file (which is the same sequence shown in the gif).
